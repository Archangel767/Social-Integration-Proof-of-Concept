# Social Integration Proof-of-Concept

## User Story for your target client:
- As an science and astronomy teacher, I would like a website that curates reddit content, specificly r/space, so that my students can have access to the latest news updates, without needing actually go to go to reddit.com, which is distracting and currently blocked on the school wifi.

## Summary of market and problem that your social media integration solves:
- Due to restrictions often placed on Wifi browsing, there can often be educational resources that are made unavaible.  By having curated content submitted to a whitelisted website, this could potentially get around such blocks.

- The targeted market would be any institution that wishes to have the latest information on a target subject, but is handicapped with heavy restrictions on local network or wifi browsing. 

- By choosing a heavily moderated subreddit such as r/space, you can ensure the most up to date content always being delivered to your students, without worrying about dangerous or lewd content sneaking into the feed.
